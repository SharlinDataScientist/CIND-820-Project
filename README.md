# CIND-820-Project
This project implies successful implementation of machine learning algorithms to make better predictions on public dataset. I possess business knowledge of finance, commercial banking, and currently working for loan department. In finance industry, retail & commercial banks have set their business goals to extend credit to their prospects and target high outstanding balances to hit their targets.
Despite modern era, commercial banks’ operations are cumbersome, lack full automation and models to predict credit risk in short period of time. Lending credit to any individual or businesses include but not limited to adjudication based on their personal bureau report, previous paid or unpaid bankruptcy, score, income, net worth, financial ratios and retained earnings.  Default loan prediction model is quite common researched topic in data science; however, it aligns to most of our day-to-day credit use and decision took by bankers on client’s request. It is critical to understand what could bring better result and how bias can be eliminated. Hence, we chose well researched topic to gain experience and understand more about machine learning and its algorithms.
